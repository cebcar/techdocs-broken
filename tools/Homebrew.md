# Using Homebrew
*establish Admin access for HomeBrew installation*
> su carolclark

*avoid GateKeeper's intrusive dialogs when opening new apps*
> brew install --no-quarantine &lt;name&gt;<br>
  *now preset in zshrc:*
  export HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS="--no-quarantine"

*write Brewfile*
> cd ~/dotfiles
> brew bundle dump --force --describe<br>

  resulting Brewfile includes what Homebrew has installed so far

*uninstall a package*
> brew uninstall &lt;name&gt;<br>

*list installed packages and casks*<br>
> brew bundle list [ --brews | --casks | --taps | --all ]<br>

> NOTE: output may be affected by whether a Brewfile is present
